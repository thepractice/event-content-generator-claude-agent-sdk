### Example 1: Thought Leadership
The average enterprise uses 187 different apps. Each one is a potential entry point for attackers.

That's why Zero Trust isn't optional anymore - it's essential.

At our annual security summit last month, we heard from CISOs managing this exact challenge. The common thread? Identity is the new perimeter.

When you can verify every user, every device, every access request, the "where" matters less than the "who."

Join our upcoming webinar to hear how three Fortune 500 companies are implementing identity-first security.

### Example 2: Customer Story
"We went from 3-week provisioning cycles to same-day access."

That's Maria, IT Director at a 10,000-person healthcare company. Her team was drowning in manual access requests.

Now? Automated lifecycle management means new hires are productive on day one. And when someone leaves, access is revoked instantly - not days later.

See how her team made the switch: [link]
