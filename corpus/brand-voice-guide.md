# Brand Voice Guide

## Our Voice Principles

### Confident, Not Arrogant
We know our stuff, but we don't talk down to our audience. We're peers sharing expertise, not lecturers demanding attention.

**Do:** "Here's what we've learned from working with 500+ enterprise teams."
**Don't:** "As the industry leader, we know more about this than anyone."

### Clear, Not Dumbed Down
We explain complex topics without jargon, but we don't oversimplify. Our audience is smart - they just need the right information.

**Do:** "Zero Trust means verifying every access request, regardless of where it comes from."
**Don't:** "Zero Trust is like checking IDs at every door in your house."

### Action-Oriented, Not Pushy
Every piece of content should help the reader do something. But we guide, we don't shove.

**Do:** "Ready to see how this works for your team? Let's talk."
**Don't:** "SIGN UP NOW before you fall behind your competitors!!!"

## Words We Use / Don't Use

## CTA Best Practices

CTAs should answer: "What will I get, and what do I do next?"

**Strong CTAs:**
- "See how [Company] reduced breach risk by 60%"
- "Get your free security assessment"
- "Watch the 5-minute demo"

**Weak CTAs:**
- "Learn more"
- "Click here"
- "Submit"
