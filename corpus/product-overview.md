# Product Overview

## What We Do

Our identity platform helps organizations secure access to all their applications and resources. We enable Zero Trust security by verifying every user, every device, every access attempt.

## Key Capabilities

One login for all applications. Employees access everything they need with a single set of credentials, while IT maintains complete visibility and control.

- Supports 7,000+ pre-built integrations
- Works with cloud, on-premise, and custom apps
