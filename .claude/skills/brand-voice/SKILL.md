# Brand Voice Guidelines

This skill defines how to write content that matches our brand voice.

## Core Tone

Our voice is:
- **Professional** but approachable
- **Confident** but not arrogant
- **Clear** and direct
- **Action-oriented** but not pushy

We speak to our audience as peers and colleagues, not as authorities lecturing from above.

## Writing Style

### Do
- Use **short sentences** when possible
- Use **active voice** (not passive)
- Use **concrete examples** over abstract claims
- Use **"you" and "your"** to address the reader directly
- Use **specific numbers** when available and verifiable

### Don't
- Don't use jargon unless your audience uses it daily
- Don't use filler words ("very", "really", "quite")
- Don't use passive constructions ("will be learned" → "you'll learn")
- Don't over-promise ("guaranteed" unless truly guaranteed)

## Words to Use

Strong action words:
- "Discover", "Learn", "Join", "Explore"
- "Build", "Create", "Transform"
- "Reduce", "Improve", "Accelerate"

Inclusive language:
- "Teams", "Organizations" (not "users" or "customers")
- "You", "Your" (direct address)
- "Together", "Collaborate"

## Words to Avoid

Overused buzzwords:
- "Revolutionary", "Game-changing", "Cutting-edge"
- "Synergy", "Leverage", "Paradigm"
- "Best-in-class" (unless verifiable with citation)
- "World-class", "Industry-leading" (hyperbole)

Corporate jargon:
- "Circle back", "Move the needle", "Low-hanging fruit"
- "At the end of the day", "Going forward"

## Examples

### Good Examples

LinkedIn:
> "Join 500+ security leaders at our Zero Trust workshop. You'll learn practical implementation strategies that have helped teams reduce security incidents by 75%."

Email:
> "Hi [Name], we're hosting a webinar on API security next Tuesday. In 45 minutes, you'll learn how to protect your endpoints without slowing down your developers. Register here."

### Bad Examples

LinkedIn:
> "Revolutionary best-in-class synergistic security solutions will transform your paradigm!"

Email:
> "We are pleased to announce that a webinar will be held by our team on the topic of API security which will be conducted on Tuesday."

## Channel-Specific Adjustments

- **LinkedIn**: More thought-leadership tone, can be slightly longer
- **Email**: More personal, direct, like writing to a colleague
- **Web**: Punchy, scannable, benefit-focused

## Scoring Guidance

When the `critique_draft` tool scores brand voice:
- **7-10**: Matches our voice well
- **4-6**: Partial match, needs adjustment
- **0-3**: Significantly off-brand

If your score is below 7, review this skill and revise:
- Check for passive voice
- Check for jargon/buzzwords
- Check for vague vs. concrete language
- Check for direct address ("you")
